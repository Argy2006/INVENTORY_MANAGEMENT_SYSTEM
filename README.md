# Grocery Store Inventory System
## Project Overview
This project is a menu-driven C++ program that simulates an Inventory Management System for a grocery store.
It uses array-based data structures to store item details and implements operations such as insertion, deletion, search, display, row/column ordering, and sparse representation.

This project is part of Lab Assignment 1 (Data Structures - Arrays & Complexity Analysis).

## Features
Insert Item – Add a new item record (ID, Name, Quantity, Price).
Delete Item – Remove an item using its unique ID.
Search Item – Search for an item by ID or Name.
Display All Items – Show all items in the inventory.
Row-Major & Column-Major Ordering – Manage Price and Quantity tables.
Sparse Representation – Display items with stock less than or equal to a user-defined threshold.
 ## === sample run code ===
